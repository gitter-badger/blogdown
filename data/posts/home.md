### Welcome

It's long overdue that I get back to blogging. It's not that I don't know what to talk about. I have plenty of things, concepts, ideas that I'd love to share. It's just that it's hard for me to put them down in coherent texts. 

But I figured that I should just take a dive a try. It may not be the best writing style, but I hope I'll get better at it by forcing me to doing it more.
